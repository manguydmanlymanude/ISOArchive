# Welcome to my Mini ISO Archive!
This is a small collection of ISO files I have, and it is actively growing!

<b>I don't have anything of MacOS yet, mostly because they can't optimize ANYTHING and Tahoe is roughly 19GB :(</b>

But, hey! I wanted to do this because I thought it was neat and I'm sorta new to software development and stuff (I know like, thousands of other archives exist of this stuff but this is cool to me)

So, if you have any suggestions, I will be glad to take them. Thanks!
